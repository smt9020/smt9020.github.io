                    <p> In this article the author points out 3 agile principles that can be interpretted in a way that can hinder your project's progress.<p>
                    <p> I have heard #1, <b>delivery over quality</b>, from people over and over again and have seen it myself. Getting things to a deliverable state as soon as possible can lead to a line of thinking that ignores the future.  You are expected to develop exactly to the story description and nothing more.  Then when it's time to do another story you have to go back and rework what was done in story #1 to figure out how you will add in story #2.  
                    <p>Another point of this article: "agile promotes the practice of ignoring defects".  When a defect is found, it is thrown into an endless queue of defects.  So then you end up adding on iterations to deal with all the defects, or simply "deferring" them in order to fit in new features.  Whether or not those deferred defects ever surface again is on a team to team basis I would imagine.  </p>
                    <p> His third point, <b>collaboration over management</b>, I have not experienced; of teams I have been on most of the Scrum Masters have had a pretty firm grip on the direction of the team and the project. I <i>have</i> seen a lack of collaboration amongst the different team roles.  I have primarily sat as a QA rep on agile teams, and have seen struggles with collaborating with the whole of the QA department (as to ensure consistency and collaboration amongst projects).  I have also seen teams struggle with the idea of being "told what to test".  QA should be deciding to what degree each feature is tested based on their knowledge of the project.  Occasionally team members will "suggest" that certain things don't need to be tested together, and in the isolation of an agile team it can be convincing. You will be pressured to agree, and not a team player if you test outside the promoted confines. </p>
