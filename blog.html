                    <p> Another tried and true example of functions written by Joe using OTA that I will reference time and again: <a href="http://www.joecolantonio.com/2010/08/17/how-to-save-and-retrieve-a-qc-test-resource/"> Uploading a resource </a>

He misses something at the end of step 3.  He says that you have to go into the Test Configurations > Data tab in order to mark your test as dynamic and reference the datasheet.  Which is all correct.  But THEN you have to click the map button on the right of that which he doesn't show, and map all your parameters again.  If you don't do that, then it will always use the values from the datasheet you updated to UFT, and it won't run based on your updates to Test Resources.  But once you enter in those mapping values you might see something like this....<code> Index was out of range. Must be non-negative and less than the size of the collection </code>.....  THAT means that you need to delete the mappings that you just put in.  Good news is, you won't have the problem of your test resources not updating anymore. Bad news is you feel like this was a waste of your time. I &lt;3 HP </p>

    </h4>
  </div>
  <div id="collapse4" class="panel-collapse collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
    	<p> I'm sure there is a lot more to it then this, but over time I hope to compile a list of things you need for a good Selenium framework.  "Good" is going to mean something different to everyone, and is going to depend a lot on who your audience is.  In many projects, your audience is the developers who want to be able to test basic functionality of their web app over and over without having to do it manually.  It's also common to see selenium wrapped in continuous integration solutions like <a href= "https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Selenium+Plugin">Jenkins</a> or TeamCity.  My audience in this case is the QA group.  How can we create a maintainable group of tests that can be run and maintained during regression testing by Test Engineers who do not have experience with coding? There are several building blocks for creating a Selenium framework that BOTH soltutions may find useful. </p>

      <ul>
        <li><b> Test Input </b></li>
          <p> A way of structuring the parameters of your test so that you can run the same test over and over with different boundary cases.  If your audiences is mostly tech-saavy developers, you can do this with command line arguments.  If they are not, you can do this with a custom runner, or supplying a spreadsheet that your test can parse. Alternatively you can create a custom connecttion of your Selenium framework to test management solutions such as HP QC, and use the parameter support that comes with that. </p>
        <li><b> Object Repository </b></li>
           <p> Organizing your page objects so that you can reference them with a friendly-name, and also only have to make a change in one place when a UI change will alter your test or break it.  This can be as simple as a class of constants with xpaths to identify different buttons on a screen.  It could also take the form of a spreadsheet. Load your spreadsheet into an ObjectRepository object so that you can do things like <code>ObjectRepo("button-name").Click(1)</code>. <b>What about sharing my object repositories between pages? How do we know which ObjRepos to load in? ...still investigating...</b> </p>
        <li><b> Assertions and Reporting </b></li>
          <p> Using NUnit or JUnit for assertions is a pretty easy win.  And then you can create your own logging, or get really fancy and use something like log4net. </p>
        <li><b> Libraries </b></li>
          <p> Broken down by page = Useful more when your audience is development </p>
          <p> Abstract with methods such as "click element" = Useful more when your audience is QA </p>
        <li><b> Version Control </b></li>
          <p> Obviously you need to version control your Selenium code.  But what about controlling which versions of the test work on which versions of the product you are testing?  You need to have a way of versioning your object repository and your task flow based on which version of the product that test will work on. </p>
        <li><b> Batch Runner </b></li>
          <p> <a href="https://blogs.perficient.com/multi-shoring/blog/2013/05/23/selenium-test-automation-using-ant/">Apache ANT</a> for batch execution on many manual testers machines. </p>
        <li><b> Screenshots during runs </b></li>
          <p> Do we want to take screen shots during our runs of the test? Or at particular key moments? Maybe whenever there is fail? how would this work?  Could this be leveraged for language testing? </p>
        <li><b> List of Best Practices for Developers </b></li>
          <p> There should be a list of best practices for automation developers.  See this article <a href="https://mestachs.wordpress.com/2012/08/13/selenium-best-practices/">Selenium Best Practices</a>.  There should also be one for application developers, that outlines things <i>they</i> can do to make automation of the webpages easier.  For example, making sure all their elements are associated with unique IDs</p>
        <li><b> Every Test should clean itself up </b></li>
          <p> </p>
        <li><b> Can you use Selenium with an Emulator? </b></li>
         <p> It only does web pages, so really I think this would only mean "can you have a small screen" to which the answer is yes? </p>
      </ul>

    </h4>
  </div>
  <div id="collapse6" class="panel-collapse collapse">
    <div class="panel-body">
      <p> These directions were meant for someone using UFT and wanting to also use their own .dlls as part of the code (which can really come in handy).  But it is probably also useful for anyone using vbscript that needs to incorporate C# code for some reason.  Here are the different wats I found to do this: </p>

<h3>VBSCRIPT:</h3> 
<div class="well">
<code>strFile = "C:\\Users\\me\\ShannonPractice.dll" <br>
Set oCustom = DotNetFactory.CreateInstance("MyNamespace.PublicClass", strFile) <br>
MsgBox oCustom.myMethod 'this will give you whatever the method would return </code>
</div>


<h3>C# (UFT Specific Version): </h3>
<ol>
  <li>In the CustomCode test, click View> Solution Explorer</li>
  <li>Right click on References and select Add Reference…</li>
  <li>In the Add Reference dialog, click on the .Net Assembly Browser tab and navigate to the location where you have your DLL</li>
  <li>Select each DLL and click Select</li>
  <li>Click Ok</li>
  <li>In the TestUserCode.cs, add the appropriate using namespace statements.</li>
  <li>Now in TestUserCode.cs you can type something like (new PublicClass().myMethod()) and actually use the methods from the DLL </li>
</ol>

<h3>C# (Load during run time): </h3>
<div class="well">
<code>
using System.Reflection; <br>
      …<br>
var myDLL = Assembly.LoadFile(@"C:\ShannonPractice.dll"); <br>
var theType = myDLL.GetType("ShannonPractice.PublicClass"); <br>
var c = Activator.CreateInstance(theType);<br>
var method = theType.GetMethod("myString");<br>
method.Invoke(c, null);<br>
</code>

                  <div class="panel-body">
                    <p> I'm trying to output my exe to a file on the command line, so I do something like...</p>
                    <p class="well"> <code> myExecutable.exe > myLog.log</code></p>
                    <p> And that totally works.  And then I want to search through the log file for any error or disconnect messages from my executable, something like...</p>
                    <div class="well"> <code>
                        @echo off<br>
                        for %%i in (.\myLog.log) do (<br>
                        FINDSTR "error" %%i >> myfinds.txt<br>
                        )
                    </code></div>
                    <p> This also works. Now I have all of my error statements in one <code>myFinds.txt</code> file (The logging has timestamps associated with each line, so if I can pull out the errors I can look at it in one place and go to the other log files as needed to see what was around the failures).  The problem is that the <code>myLog.log</code> file gets really large; too large to maintain.  So after I do my find I want to empty the file out or rename it to something like <code>myLog.log.1272016</code>.  When I do that, I get this error message: </p>
                    <p><code> This process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process </code></p> 
                    <p> The executable is still constantly pumping output data into <code>myLog.log</code>so I can't grab ahold of it to change it in anyway. One would think, of course there is an easy fix on te internet! But I haven't been able to find one, so here's what I got so far:</p>

                    <ul>
                      <li> <a href="http://linux.101hacks.com/unix/tee-command-examples/">tee</a> command for windows.  Gotta love <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11239924/windows-batch-tee-command">StackOverflow</a></li>
                      <p> I could send my output to multiple files this way? But I'm not sure if I would then be able to edit a subset while still running my exe.  Wait also could I not just do this in powershell?</p>
                      <li><span class="label label-success">Success!</span> Create a C# solution that will set a rollover limit</li>
                      <p> Gather more info on this...a LOT of what I am seeing is that I have to use log4net which seems insane that I couldnt just have a simpler option.</p>
                      <P> <a href="http://www.dotnetperls.com/redirectstandardoutput">Running an exe and redirecting the output using C#.  Easy peasy.</a> </p>
                      <p> <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10349536/having-a-log-per-day"> log4net solution to rolling daily logs</a></p>
                      <li><span class="label label-success">Success?</span>logrotate (on linux but I have Windows so <a href="https://github.com/plecos/logrotatewin"> logrotatewin</a>)</li>
                        <p> I found this online, and it looks encouraging.  but in order to use the windows file there is setup.exe I have to run? which seems a little shady</p>
                      <li>Stop the .exe rename my log file and start the .exe</li>
                          <p> The exe I'm running will keep running until I cancel it.  So if I stop it, quickly rename my file, and restart it, it doesn't change what the executable is actually doing.  But then I run the risk that something important will happen during the time that the executable is stopped and I will miss it.  So this is probably not a good solution for me. </p>
                      <li>Change my output redirect line to <code> myExecutable.exe | find "error" > myLog.log</code> </li>
                          <p> This works, I get all the lines in the file where errors are mentioned.  But then I lose the context because I'm not saving any of the other log information. So this probably isn't my best bet either</p>
                    </ul>

                    <p> In this article the author points out 3 agile principles that can be interpretted in a way that can hinder your project's progress.<p>
                    <p> I have heard #1, <b>delivery over quality</b>, from people over and over again and have seen it myself. Getting things to a deliverable state as soon as possible can lead to a line of thinking that ignores the future.  You are expected to develop exactly to the story description and nothing more.  Then when it's time to do another story you have to go back and rework what was done in story #1 to figure out how you will add in story #2.  
                    <p>Another point of this article: "agile promotes the practice of ignoring defects".  When a defect is found, it is thrown into an endless queue of defects.  So then you end up adding on iterations to deal with all the defects, or simply "deferring" them in order to fit in new features.  Whether or not those deferred defects ever surface again is on a team to team basis I would imagine.  </p>
                    <p> His third point, <b>collaboration over management</b>, I have not experienced; of teams I have been on most of the Scrum Masters have had a pretty firm grip on the direction of the team and the project. I <i>have</i> seen a lack of collaboration amongst the different team roles.  I have primarily sat as a QA rep on agile teams, and have seen struggles with collaborating with the whole of the QA department (as to ensure consistency and collaboration amongst projects).  I have also seen teams struggle with the idea of being "told what to test".  QA should be deciding to what degree each feature is tested based on their knowledge of the project.  Occasionally team members will "suggest" that certain things don't need to be tested together, and in the isolation of an agile team it can be convincing. You will be pressured to agree, and not a team player if you test outside the promoted confines. </p>
